# PDFMerge

A small program I created primarily for my personal use, but you can use it also if you want. As the name implies, 
this program enables the combination of multiple PDF files into one. The resulting PDF will be put in whichever 
directory you're working in

Here's an example of a bash alias. Obviously change the file path to suit your needs.

```
alias mergepdf="/bin/python /home/cicada/Documents/OSSProjects/PDFMerge/merge.py"
```
